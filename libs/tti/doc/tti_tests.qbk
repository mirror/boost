[section:tti_tests Testing TTI]

In the libs/tti/test subdirectory there is a jamfile 
which can be used to test TTI functionality.

Executing the jamfile without a target will run tests 
for both basic TTI and for the variadic macro 
portion of TTI. To successfully do that you need to 
get the `variadic_macro_data` library from the sandbox.
You can run tests for only the basic TTI, which is the 
vast majority of TTI functionality, by specifying only 
the 'tti' target when executing the jamfile, and therefore 
you would not need the `variadic_macro_data` library. If you 
just want to run the tests for the variadic macro portion 
of TTI, specify the target as 'ttivm'.

The TTI library has been tested with VC++ 8, 9, 10 and with 
gcc 3.4.2, 3.4.5, 4.3.0, 4.4.0, 4.5.0-1, and 4.5.2-1.
