[section Sequences]

Like __mpl__, the Sequence is a fundamental concept in Fusion. A Sequence
may or may not actually store or contain data. __containers__ are sequences
that hold data. __views__, on the other hand, are sequences that do not
store any data. Instead, they are proxies that impart an alternative
presentation over another sequence. All models of Sequence have an
associated __iterator__ type that can be used to iterate through the
Sequence's elements.

[heading Header]

    #include <boost/fusion/sequence.hpp>

[section Concepts]

Fusion Sequences are organized into a hierarchy of concepts.

[heading Traversal]

Fusion's sequence traversal related concepts parallel Fusion's
__iterator_concepts__. __forward_sequence__ is the most basic concept.
__bidirectional_sequence__ is a refinement of __forward_sequence__.
__random_access_sequence__ is a refinement of __bidirectional_sequence__.
These concepts pertain to sequence traversal.

[heading Associativity]

The __associative_sequence__ concept is orthogonal to traversal. An Associative
Sequence allows efficient retrieval of elements based on keys.

[section Forward Sequence]

[heading Description]

A Forward Sequence is a Sequence whose elements are arranged in a definite
order. The ordering is guaranteed not to change from iteration to
iteration. The requirement of a definite ordering allows the definition of
element-by-element equality (if the container's element type is Equality
Comparable) and of lexicographical ordering (if the container's element
type is LessThan Comparable).

[variablelist Notation
    [[`s`]       [A Forward Sequence]]
    [[`S`]       [A Forward Sequence type]]
    [[`o`]       [An arbitrary object]]
    [[`e`]       [A Sequence element]]
]

[heading Valid Expressions]

For any Forward Sequence the following expressions must be valid:

[table
    [[Expression]       [Return type]               [Type Requirements]     [Runtime Complexity]]

[heading Invariants]

For any Forward Sequence s the following invariants always hold:

* `[__begin__(s), __end__(s))` is always a valid range.
* An __algorithm__ that iterates through the range `[__begin__(s), __end__(s))`
  will pass through every element of `s` exactly once.
* `__begin__(s)` is identical to `__end__(s))` if and only if `s` is empty.
* Two different iterations through `s` will access its elements in
  the same order.

[section Associative Sequence]

[heading Description]

An Associative Sequence allows efficient retrieval of elements based on keys.
Like associative sequences in __mpl__, and unlike associative containers in
__stl__, Fusion associative sequences have no implied ordering relation.
Instead, type identity is used to impose an equivalence relation on keys, and
the order in which sequence elements are traversed during iteration is left
unspecified. In addition, unlike __stl__, Associative Sequences have mutable
iterators. This is due to the fact that there is no associated ordering relation
and the runtime value of the keys themselves do not have any effect on the
associativity of the sequence.

[section Containers]

Fusion provides a few predefined sequences out of the box. These
/containers/ actually hold heterogenously typed data; unlike
__views__. These containers are more or less counterparts of those in __stl__.

[heading Header]

    #include <boost/fusion/sequence/container.hpp>

[section vector]

[heading Description]

`vector` is a __random_access_sequence__ of heterogenous typed
data structured as a simple `struct` where each element is held
as a member variable. `vector` is the simplest of the Fusion
sequence container, and in many cases the most efficient.

    >
    struct vector;

The numbered form accepts the exact number of elements. Example:

    vector3<int, char, double>

The variadic form accepts `0` to `FUSION_MAX_VECTOR_SIZE` elements, where
`FUSION_MAX_VECTOR_SIZE` is a user definable predefined maximum that
defaults to `10`. Example:

    vector<int, char, double>

You may define the preprocessor constant `FUSION_MAX_VECTOR_SIZE` before
including any Fusion header to change the default. Example:

    #define FUSION_MAX_VECTOR_SIZE 20

[section cons]

[heading Description]

`cons` is a simple __forward_sequence__. It is a lisp style recursive list
structure where `car` is the /head/ and `cdr` is the /tail/: usually
another cons structure or `nil`: the empty list. Fusion's __list__ is built
on top of this more primitive data structure. It is more efficient than
__vector__ when the target sequence is constructed piecemeal (a data at a
time). The runtime cost of access to each element is peculiarly constant
(see __recursive_inline__).

[heading Expression Semantics]

Semantics of an expression is defined only where it differs from, or is not
defined in __forward_sequence__.

[table
    [[Expression]           [Semantics]]
    [[`nil()`]              [Creates an empty list.]]

[blurb __note__ `__at__<N>(l)` is provided for convenience and compatibility
with the original __tuple__ library, despite `cons` being a
__forward_sequence__ only (`at` is supposed to be a
__random_access_sequence__ requirement). The runtime complexity of __at__ is
constant (see __recursive_inline__).]

    cons<int, cons<float> > l(12, cons<float>(5.5f));

[heading Expression Semantics]

Semantics of an expression is defined only where it differs from, or is not
defined in __forward_sequence__.

[blurb __note__ `__at__<n>(l)` is provided for convenience and compatibility
with the original __tuple__ library, despite `list` being a
__forward_sequence__ only (__at__ is supposed to be a
__random_access_sequence__ requirement). The runtime complexity of __at__ is
constant (see __recursive_inline__).]

[section set]

[heading Description]

set is an __associative_sequence__ of heteregenous typed data elements.
Type identity is used to impose an equivalence relation on keys. The
element's type is its key. A set may contain at most one element for each
key. Membership testing and element key lookup has constant runtime
complexity (see __overloaded_functions__).

[heading Header]

    #include <boost/fusion/sequence/container/set.hpp>

[heading Synopsis]

    template <
        typename T0 = __unspecified__
      , typename T1 = __unspecified__
      , typename T2 = __unspecified__
        ...
      , typename TN = __unspecified__
    >
    struct set;

The variadic class interface accepts `0` to `FUSION_MAX_SET_SIZE` elements,
where `FUSION_MAX_SET_SIZE` is a user definable predefined maximum that
defaults to `10`. Example:

    set<int, char, double>

You may define the preprocessor constant `FUSION_MAX_SET_SIZE` before
including any Fusion header to change the default. Example:

    #define FUSION_MAX_SET_SIZE 20

[section map]

[heading Description]

map is an __associative_sequence__ of heteregenous typed data elements.
Each element is a key/data pair (see __fusion_pair__) where the key has no
data (type only). Type identity is used to impose an equivalence relation
on keys. A map may contain at most one element for each key. Membership
testing and element key lookup has constant runtime complexity (see
__overloaded_functions__).

[heading Header]

      , typename T2 = __unspecified__
        ...
      , typename TN = __unspecified__
    >
    struct map;

The variadic class interface accepts `0` to `FUSION_MAX_MAP_SIZE` elements,
where `FUSION_MAX_MAP_SIZE` is a user definable predefined maximum that
defaults to `10`. Example:

    map<__pair__<int, char>, __pair__<char, char>, __pair__<double, char> >

[section Views]

Views are sequences that do not actually contain data, but instead impart
an alternative presentation over the data from one or more underlying
sequences. Views are proxies. They provide an efficient yet purely
functional way to work on potentially expensive sequence operations. Views
are inherently lazy. Their elements are only computed on demand only when
the elements of the underlying sequence(s) are actually accessed. Views'
lazy nature make them very cheap to copy and be passed around by value.

[section Adapted]

Fusion provides a couple of adapters for other sequences such as

written using Fusion's non-intrusive __extension__ mechanism. If you wish
to use these sequences with fusion, simply include the necessary files and
they will be regarded as first-class, fully conforming fusion sequences
[footnote Fusion sequences may also be adapted as fully conforming __mpl__
sequences (see __intrinsics__). That way, we can have 2-way adaptation to
and from __mpl__ and Fusion].

header makes all __mpl__ sequences fully conforming fusion sequences.

[heading Header]

    #include <boost/fusion/sequence/adapted/mpl.hpp>

[heading Model of]

* __bidirectional_sequence__ (If the __mpl__ sequence is a bidirectional sequence.)
* __random_access_sequence__ (If the __mpl__ sequence is a random access sequence.)

[heading Example]

    mpl::vector_c<int, 123, 456> vec_c;
    fusion::vector2<int, long> v(vec_c);
    std::cout << __at_c__<0>(v) << std::endl;

[section boost::variant]
This module provides adapters for `boost::variant`. Including the module
header makes `boost::variant` a fully conforming __forward_sequence__.
The variant acts as a sequence of the types that can be contained in the variant.
Accessing types not currently stored int the variant will lead to the variant
being populated with a default constructed value of that type.

    #include <boost/fusion/sequence/adapted/variant.hpp>

[heading Model of]

* __forward_sequence__

[heading Example]

    boost::variant<int,std::string> example_variant = 101;

[section Intrinsics]

Intrinsics form the essential interface of every Fusion __sequence__. __stl__
counterparts of these functions are usually implemented as member
functions. Intrinsic functions, unlike __algorithms__, are not generic
across the full __sequence__ repertoire. They need to be implemented for
each Fusion __sequence__[footnote In practice, many of intrinsic functions
have default implementations that will work in majority of cases].

[section Tiers]

Tiers are sequences, where all elements are non-const reference types. They
are constructed with a call to a couple of /tie/ function templates. The
succeeding sections document the various /tier/ flavors.

* __list_tie__
* __vector_tie__
* __map_tie__

Example:

    int i; char c; double d;
      ...
    __vector_tie__(i, c, a);

The __vector_tie__ function creates a __vector__ of type
`__vector__<int&, char&, double&>`. The same result could be achieved with the call
__make_vector__(__boost_ref_call__(i), __boost_ref_call__(c), __boost_ref_call__(a))
[footnote see __boost_ref__ for details about `ref`].

A /tie/ can be used to 'unpack' another tuple into variables. E.g.:

    int i; char c; double d;
    __vector_tie__(i, c, d) = __make_vector__(1,'a', 5.5);
    std::cout << i << " " <<  c << " " << d;

This code prints 1 a 5.5 to the standard output stream. A sequence
unpacking operation like this is found for example in ML and Python. It is
convenient when calling functions which return sequences.

[heading Ignore]

There is also an object called /ignore/ which allows you to ignore an
element assigned by a sequence. The idea is that a function may return a
sequence, only part of which you are interested in. For example:

    char c;
    __vector_tie__(ignore, c) = __make_vector__(1, 'a');

[endsect]

[section Operators]

These operators, like the __algorithms__, work generically on all Fusion
sequences. All conforming Fusion sequences automatically get these
operators for free.

[section I/O]

The I/O operators: `<<` and `>>` work generically on all Fusion sequences.
The global `operator<<` has been overloaded for generic output streams such
that __sequence__s are output by recursively calling `operator<<` for each
element. Analogously, the global `operator>>` has been overloaded to
extract __sequence__s from generic input streams by recursively calling
`operator>>` for each element.

The default delimiter between the elements is space, and the __sequence__
is enclosed in parenthesis. For Example:

    __vector__<float, int, std::string> a(1.0f, 2, std::string("Howdy folks!");
    cout << a;

outputs the __vector__ as: (1.0 2 Howdy folks!)

The library defines three manipulators for changing the default behavior:

[variablelist Manipulators
    [[`tuple_open(arg)`]        [Defines the character that is output before the first element.]]
    [[`tuple_close(arg)`]       [Defines the character that is output after the last element.]]
    [[`tuple_delimiter(arg)`]   [Defines the delimiter character between elements.]]
]

The argument to `tuple_open`, `tuple_close` and `tuple_delimiter` may be a
`char`, `wchar_t`, a C-string, or a wide C-string.

Example:

    std::cout << tuple_open('[') << tuple_close(']') << tuple_delimiter(", ") << a;

outputs the same __vector__, `a` as: [1.0, 2, Howdy folks!]

The same manipulators work with `operator>>` and `istream` as well. Suppose
the `std::cin` stream contains the following data:

    (1 2 3) [4:5]

The code:

    __vector__<int, int, int> i;
    __vector__<int, int> j;

    std::cin >> i;
    std::cin >> set_open('[') >> set_close(']') >> set_delimiter(':');
    std::cin >> j;

reads the data into the __vector__s `i` and `j`.

Note that extracting __sequence__s with `std::string` or C-style string
elements does not generally work, since the streamed __sequence__
representation may not be unambiguously parseable.

[heading Header]

[section Comparison]
