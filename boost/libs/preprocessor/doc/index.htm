<h1>Boost PREPROCESSOR library</h1>

<p>C++ programming sometimes involves repeating lists of template or function 
  parameters. Such repetition is troublesome, because it tends to be done manually, 
  which means that the maximum number of parameters is bound into the design of 
  the program making it difficult to configure. Automating the repetition using 
  extra linguistic tools introduces another set of problems.</p>
<p>The C preprocessor is part of the C++ language and can manipulate and generate 
  tokens. Unfortunately the C preprocessor is also a very low level macro processor. 
  In particular, it doesn't directly support repetition or recursion. Fortunately 
  it is possible to perform finite repetition and recursion using a library of 
  preprocessor primitives.</p>
<p>The PREPROCESSOR library provides facilities for C preprocessor metaprogramming. 
  Preprocessor metaprogramming makes it possible to generate function and template 
  parameter lists and make libraries configurable through preprocessor definitions.</p>

<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>

<p>The original idea of passing two extra parameters to REPEAT, which makes it 
  possible to create preprocessor code on top of it, was due to Aleksey Gurtovoy. 
  The invokeable IDENTITY macro was also invented by him. He also suggested the 
  name for the library. Many thanks to Aleksey for his insights!</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who participated in the review: David Abrahams, Beman Dawes, 
  Ronald Garcia, Douglas Gregor, Aleksey Gurtovoy, Jeremy Siek, and Daryle Walker.</p>
<p>The PREPROCESSOR library has been developed by
