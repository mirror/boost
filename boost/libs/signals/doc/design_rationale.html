  <hr><h2><a name="slotdef">Choice of Slot Definitions</a></h2>
  <p> The definition of a slot differs amongst signals and slots
  libraries. Within Boost.Signals, a slot is defined in a very loose
  manner: it can be any function object that is callable given
  parameters of the types specified by the signal, and whose return
  value is convertible to the result type expected by the
  signal. However, alternative definitions have associated pros and
  cons that were considered prior to the construction of
  Boost.Signals.

  <ul>
    <li><b>Slots derive from a specific base class</b>: generally a
    scheme such as this will require all user-defined slots to derive
    from some library-specified <code>Slot</code> abstract class
    that defines a virtual function calling the slot. Adaptors can be
    used to convert a definition such as this to a definition similar
    to that used by Boost.Signals, but in this case the original
    specification ties the implementation to the use of virtual
    functions internally. This approach does have the benefit of
    simplicity of implementation and user interface, from an
    object-oriented perspective.</li>

    <li><b>Slots constructed from a set of primitives</b>: in this
    scheme the slot can have a limited set of types (often derived
    from a common abstract base class) that are constructed from some
    library-defined set of primitives that often include conversions
    from free function pointers and member function pointers, and a
    limited set of binding capabilities. Such an approach is
    reasonably simple and cover most common cases, but it does not
    allow a large degree of flexibility in slot
    construction. Libraries for function object composition have
    become quite advanced and it is out of the scope of a signals and
    slots library to encorporate such enhancements. Thus Boost.Signals
    does not include argument binding or function object composition
    primitives, but instead uses a set of well-defined interfaces to
    discover information about the composition of arbitrary function
    objects.</li>
  </ul>

  <p> Users not satisfied with the slot definition choice may opt to
  replace the default slot function type with an alternative that
  meets their specific needs.

  <h2><a name="user_connect">User-level Connection Management</a></h2>
  <p> Users need to have fine control over the connection of signals
  to slots and their eventual disconnection. The approach taken by
  Boost.Signals is to return a <a
  href="reference/connection.html"><code>connection</code></a> object
  that enables connected/disconnected query, manual disconnection, and
  an automatic disconnection on destruction mode. Some other possible
  interfaces include:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Pass slot to disconnect</b>: in this interface model, the
    disconnection of a slot connected with
    <code>sig.connect(slot)</code> is performed via
    <code>sig.disconnect(slot)</code>. Internally, a linear search
    using slot comparison is performed and the slot, if found, is
    removed from the list. Unfortunately, querying connectedness will
    generally also end up as linear-time operations. This model also
    fails for implementation reasons when slots become more complex
    than simple function pointers, member function pointers, and a
    limited set of compositions and argument binders it is tough to
    rely on comparison of function objects because arbitrary function
    objects are not comparable.</li>
    <li><b>Pass a token to disconnect</b>: this approach identifies
    slots with a token that is easily comparable (e.g., a string),
    enabling slots to be arbitrary function objects. While this
    approach is essentially equivalent to the approach taken by
    Boost.Signals, it is possibly more error-prone for several
    reasons:
    <ul>
      <li>Connections and disconnections must be paired, so the
      problem becomes similar to the problems incurred when pairing
      <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code> for dynamic memory
      allocation. While errors of this sort would not be catastrophic
      for a signals and slots implementation, their detection is
      generally nontrivial.</li>
      <li>Tokens must be unique, otherwise two slots will have the
      same name and will be indistinguishable. In environments where
      many connections will be made dynamically, name generation
      becomes an additional task for the user. Uniqueness of tokens
      also results in an additional failure mode when attempting to
      connect a slot using a token that has already been used. </li>
      <li>More parameterization would be required, because the token
      type must be user-defined. Additional parameterization steepens
      the learning curver and overcomplicates a simple interface.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> This type of interface is supported in Boost.Signals via the
          named connections mechanism. It augments the <a
  href="reference/connection.html"><code>connection</code></a>
          object-based connection management scheme.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2><a name="combiners">Combiner Interface</a></h2>
  <p> The Combiner interface was chosen to mimic a call to an
  algorithm in the C++ standard library. It is felt that by viewing
  slot call results as merely a sequence of values accessed by input
  iterators, the combiner interface would be most natural to a
  proficient C++ programmer. Competing interface design generally
  required the combiners to be constructed to conform to an interface
  that would be customized for (and limited to) the Signals
  library. While these interfaces are generally enable more
  straighforward implementation of the signals &amp; slots libraries,
  the combiners are unfortunately not reusable (either in other
  signals &amp; slots libraries or within other generic algorithms),
  and the learning curve is steepened slightly to learn the specific
  combiner interface.

  <p> The Signals formulation of combiners is based on the combiner
  using the "pull" mode of communication, instead of the more complex
  "push" mechanism. With a "pull" mechanism, the combiner's state can
  be kept on the stack and in the program counter, because whenever
  new data is required (i.e., calling the next slot to retrieve its
  return value), there is a simple interface to retrieve that data
  immediately and without returning from the combiner's code. Contrast
  this with the "push" mechanism, where the combiner must keep all
  state in class members because the combiner's routines will be
  invoked for each signal called. Compare, for example, a combiner
  that returns the maximum element from calling the slots. If the
  maximum element ever exceeds 100, no more slots are to be
  called. 

  <table border=1>
    <tr>
      <th>Pull</th>
      <th>Push</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
  <pre>
struct pull_max {
  typedef int result_type;

  template&lt;typename InputIterator&gt;
  result_type operator()(InputIterator first,
                         InputIterator last)
  {
    if (first == last)
      throw std::runtime_error("Empty!");

    int max_value = *first++;
    while(first != last && *first &lt;= 100) {
      if (*first &gt; max_value)
        max_value = *first;
      ++first;
    }

    return max_value;
  }
};
  </pre>
      </td>
      <td>
  <pre>
struct push_max {
  typedef int result_type;

  push_max() : max_value(), got_first(false) {}

  // returns false when we want to stop
  bool operator()(int result) {
    if (result &gt; 100)
      return false;

    if (!got_first) {
      got_first = true;
      max_value = result;
      return true;
    }

    if (result &gt; max_value)
      max_value = result;

    return true;
  }

  int get_value() const 
  { 
    if (!got_first)
      throw std::runtime_error("Empty!");
    return max_value; 
  }

private:
  int  max_value; 
  bool got_first;
};
  </pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>There are several points to note in these examples. The "pull"
  version is a reusable function object that is based on an input
  iterator sequence with an integer <code>value_type</code>, and is
  very straightforward in design. The "push" model, on the other hand,
  relies on an interface specific to the caller and is generally
  reusable. It also requires extra state values to determine, for
  instance, if any elements have been received. Though code quality
  and ease-of-use is generally subjective, the "pull" model is clearly
  shorter and more reusable and will often be construed as easier to
  write and understand, even outside the context of a signals &amp;
  slots library.

  <p> The cost of the "pull" combiner interface is paid in the
  implementation of the Signals library itself. To correctly handle
  slot disconnections during calls (e.g., when the dereference
  operator is invoked), one must construct the iterator to skip over
  disconnected slots. Additionally, the iterator must carry with it
  the set of arguments to pass to each slot (although a
  reference to a structure containing those arguments suffices), and
  must cache the result of calling the slot so that multiple
  dereferences don't result in multiple calls. This apparently
  requires a large degree of overhead, though if one considers the
  entire process of invoking slots one sees that the overhead is
  nearly equivalent to that in the "push" model, but we have inverted
  the control structures to make iteration and dereference complex
  (instead of making combiner state-finding complex).

  <h2><a name="plus_equals">Connection Interfaces: +=  operator</a></h2>
  <p> Boost.Signals supports a connection syntax with the form
  <code>sig.connect(slot)</code>, but a more terse syntax <code>sig +=
  slot</code> has been suggested (and has been used by other signals
  &amp; slots implementations). There are several reasons as to why
  this syntax has been rejected:
  <ul>
    <li><b>It's unnecessary</b>: the connection syntax supplied by
    Boost.Signals is no less powerful that than supplied by the
    signal. The savings in typing (<code>connect()</code>
    vs. <code>+=</code>) is essentially negligible. Furthemore, one
    could argue that calling <code>connect()</code> is more readable
    than an overload of <code>+=</code>.

    <li><b>Ambiguous return type</b>: 
    there is an ambiguity concerning the return value of the
    <code>+=</code> operation: should it be a reference to the signal
    itself, to enable <code>sig += slot1 += slot2</code>, or should it
    return a <code><a
    href="reference/connection.html">connection</a></code> for the
    newly-created signal/slot connection?</li>

    <li><b>Gateway to operators -=, +</b>: when one has added a
    connection operator <code>+=</code>, it seems natural to have a
    disconnection operator <code>-=</code>. However, this presents
    problems when the library allows arbitrary function objects to
    implicitly become slots, because slots are no longer comparable
    (see the discussion on this topic in <a
    href="#user_connect">User-level Connection Management</a>). 

    <p> The second obvious addition when one has
    <code>operator+=</code> would be to add a <code>+</code> operator
    that supports addition of multiple slots, followed by assignment
    to a signal. However, this would require implementing
    <code>+</code> such that it can accept any two function objects,
    which is technically infeasible.
  </ul>

  <h2><a name="trackable"><code>trackable</code> rationale</a></h2>
  <p> The <a href="reference/trackable.html"><code>trackable</code></a>
      class is the primary user interface to automatic connection
      lifetime management, and its design affects users directly. Two
      issues stick out most: the odd copying behavior of
      <code>trackable</code>, and the limitation requiring users to
      derive from <code>trackable</code> to create types that can
      participate in automatic connection management.

    <h3><code>trackable</code> copying behavior</h3>
    <p> The copying behavior of <code>trackable</code> is essentially
      that <code>trackable</code> subobjects are never copied;
      instead, the copy operation is merely a no-op. To understand
      this, we look at the nature of a signal-slot connection and note
      that the connection is based on the entities that are being
      connected; when one of the entities is destroyed, the connection
      is destroyed. Therefore, when a <code>trackable</code> subobject
      is copied, we cannot copy the connections because the
      connections don't refer to the target entity - they refer to the
      source entity. This reason is dual to the reason signals are
      noncopyable: the slots connected to them are connected to that
      particular signal, not the data contained in the signal.

    <h3>Why derivation from <code>trackable</code>?</h3>
    <p> For <code>trackable</code> to work properly, there are two
      constraints:
      <ul>
        <li><code>trackable</code> must have storage space to keep
        track of all connections made to this object.</li>
        <li><code>trackable</code> must be notified when the object is
        being destructed so that it can disconnect its
        connections.</li>
      </ul>

      Clearly, deriving from <code>trackable</code> meets these two
    guidelines. We have not yet found a superior solution.

  <hr><h2><a name="libsigc">libsigc++</a></h2>
  <p> <a href="http://libsigc.sourceforge.net">libsigc++</a> is a C++ signals
  &amp; slots library that originally started as part of an initiative
  to wrap the C interfaces to <a href="http://www.gtk.org">GTK</a>
  libraries in C++, and has grown to be a separate library maintained
  by Karl Nelson. There are many similarities between libsigc++ and
  Boost.Signals, and indeed Boost.Signals was strongly influenced by
  Karl Nelson and libsigc++. A cursory inspection of each library will
  find a similar syntax for the construction of signals and in the use
  of connections and automatic connection lifetime management. There
  are some major differences in design that separate these libraries:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Slot definitions</b>: slots in libsigc++ are created using
    a set of primitives defined by the library. These primitives allow
    binding of objects (as part of the library), explicit
    adaptation from the argument and return types of the signal to the
    argument and return types of the slot (libsigc++ is, by default, 
    more strict about types than Boost.Signals). A discussion of this
    approach with a comparison against the approach taken by 
    Boost.Signals is given in 
    <a href="#slotdef">Choice of Slot Definitions</a>.</li>

    <li><b>Combiner/Marshaller interface</b>: the equivalent to
    Boost.Signals combiners in libsigc++ are the
    marshallers. Marshallers are similar to the "push" interface
    described in <a href="#combiners">Combiner Interface</a>, and a
    proper treatment of the topic is given there.</li>
  </ul>

   <h2><a name="delegates">.NET delegates</a></h2>
   <p> <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> has introduced
      the .NET Framework and an associated set of languages and language
      extensions, one of which is the delgate. Delegates are similar
      to signals and slots, but they are more limited than most C++
      signals and slots implemetations in that they:
   <ul>
     <li>Require exact type matches between a delegate and what it is
     calling</li>
     <li>Do not allow return types</li>
     <li>Must call a method with <code>this</code> already bound</li>
   </ul>
