<H3> <A NAME="syntax"></A><I>Regular expression syntax</I></H3>
This section covers the regular expression syntax used by this library, this is
a programmers guide, the actual syntax presented to your program's users will
depend upon the flags used during expression compilation. <P><I>Literals</I> 
</P>
<P>All characters are literals except: &quot;.&quot;, &quot;*&quot;,
&quot;?&quot;, &quot;+&quot;, &quot;(&quot;, &quot;)&quot;, &quot;{&quot;,
&quot;}&quot;, &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot;, &quot;^&quot; and &quot;$&quot;.
These characters are literals when preceded by a &quot;\&quot;. A literal is a
character that matches itself, or matches the result of
traits_type::translate(), where traits_type is the traits template parameter to
class reg_expression. <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp; </P>
<P><I>Wildcard</I> </P>
<P>The dot character &quot;.&quot; matches any single character except : when
<I>match_not_dot_null</I> is passed to the matching algorithms, the dot does
not match a null character; when <I>match_not_dot_newline</I> is passed to the
matching algorithms, then the dot does not match a newline character. <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp; </P>
<P><I>Repeats</I> </P>
<P>A repeat is an expression that is repeated an arbitrary number of times. An
expression followed by &quot;*&quot; can be repeated any number of times
including zero. An expression followed by &quot;+&quot; can be repeated any
number of times, but at least once, if the expression is compiled with the flag
regbase::bk_plus_qm then &quot;+&quot; is an ordinary character and
&quot;\+&quot; represents a repeat of once or more. An expression followed by
&quot;?&quot; may be repeated zero or one times only, if the expression is
compiled with the flag regbase::bk_plus_qm then &quot;?&quot; is an ordinary
character and &quot;\?&quot; represents the repeat zero or once operator. When
it is necessary to specify the minimum and maximum number of repeats
explicitly, the bounds operator &quot;{}&quot; may be used, thus
&quot;a{2}&quot; is the letter &quot;a&quot; repeated exactly twice,
&quot;a{2,4}&quot; represents the letter &quot;a&quot; repeated between 2 and 4
times, and &quot;a{2,}&quot; represents the letter &quot;a&quot; repeated at
least twice with no upper limit. Note that there must be no white-space inside
the {}, and there is no upper limit on the values of the lower and upper
bounds. When the expression is compiled with the flag regbase::bk_braces then
&quot;{&quot; and &quot;}&quot; are ordinary characters and &quot;\{&quot; and
&quot;\}&quot; are used to delimit bounds instead. All repeat expressions refer
to the shortest possible previous sub-expression: a single character; a
character set, or a sub-expression grouped with &quot;()&quot; for example. 
</P>
<P>Examples: </P>
<P>&quot;ba*&quot; will match all of &quot;b&quot;, &quot;ba&quot;,
&quot;baaa&quot; etc. </P>
<P>&quot;ba+&quot; will match &quot;ba&quot; or &quot;baaaa&quot; for example
but not &quot;b&quot;. </P>
<P>&quot;ba?&quot; will match &quot;b&quot; or &quot;ba&quot;. </P>
<P>&quot;ba{2,4}&quot; will match &quot;baa&quot;, &quot;baaa&quot; and
&quot;baaaa&quot;. </P>
<P><I>Non-greedy repeats</I> </P>
<P>Whenever the &quot;extended&quot; regular expression syntax is in use (the
default) then non-greedy repeats are possible by appending a '?' after the
repeat; a non-greedy repeat is one which will match the <I>shortest</I>
possible string. </P>
<P>For example to match html tag pairs one could use something like: </P>
<P>&quot;&lt;\s*tagname[^&gt;]*&gt;(.*?)&lt;\s*/tagname\s*&gt;&quot; </P>
<P>In this case $1 will contain the text between the tag pairs, and will be the
shortest possible matching string. <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp; </P>
<P><I>Parenthesis</I> </P>
<P>Parentheses serve two purposes, to group items together into a
sub-expression, and to mark what generated the match. For example the
expression &quot;(ab)*&quot; would match all of the string &quot;ababab&quot;.
The matching algorithms <A
HREF="template_class_ref.htm#query_match">regex_match</A> and
<A HREF="template_class_ref.htm#reg_search">regex_search</A> each take an
instance of <A HREF="template_class_ref.htm#match_results">match_results</A> that
reports what caused the match, on exit from these functions the
<A HREF="template_class_ref.htm#match_results">match_results</A> contains information
both on what the whole expression matched and on what each sub-expression
matched. In the example above match_results[1] would contain a pair of iterators
denoting the final &quot;ab&quot; of the matching string. It is permissible for
sub-expressions to match null strings. If a sub-expression takes no part in a
match - for example if it is part of an alternative that is not taken - then
both of the iterators that are returned for that sub-expression point to the
end of the input string, and the <I>matched</I> parameter for that
sub-expression is <I>false</I>. Sub-expressions are indexed from left to right
starting from 1, sub-expression 0 is the whole expression. </P>
<P><I>Non-Marking Parenthesis</I> </P>
<P>Sometimes you need to group sub-expressions with parenthesis, but don't want
the parenthesis to spit out another marked sub-expression, in this case a
non-marking parenthesis (?:expression) can be used. For example the following
expression creates no sub-expressions: </P>
<P>&quot;(?:abc)*&quot; <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp; </P>
<P><I>Alternatives</I> </P>
<P>Alternatives occur when the expression can match either one sub-expression
or another, each alternative is separated by a &quot;|&quot;, or a
&quot;\|&quot; if the flag regbase::bk_vbar is set, or by a newline character
if the flag regbase::newline_alt is set. Each alternative is the largest
possible previous sub-expression; this is the opposite behaviour from
repetition operators. </P>
<P>Examples: </P>
<P>&quot;a(b|c)&quot; could match &quot;ab&quot; or &quot;ac&quot;. </P>
<P>&quot;abc|def&quot; could match &quot;abc&quot; or &quot;def&quot;. <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp; </P>
<P><I>Sets</I> </P>
<P>A set is a set of characters that can match any single character that is a
member of the set. Sets are delimited by &quot;[&quot; and &quot;]&quot; and
can contain literals, character ranges, character classes, collating elements
and equivalence classes. Set declarations that start with &quot;^&quot; contain
the compliment of the elements that follow. </P>
<P>Examples: </P>
<P>Character literals: </P>
<P>&quot;[abc]&quot; will match either of &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, or
&quot;c&quot;. </P>
<P>&quot;[^abc] will match any character other than &quot;a&quot;,
&quot;b&quot;, or &quot;c&quot;. </P>
<P>Character ranges: </P>
<P>&quot;[a-z]&quot; will match any character in the range &quot;a&quot; to
&quot;z&quot;. </P>
<P>&quot;[^A-Z]&quot; will match any character other than those in the range
&quot;A&quot; to &quot;Z&quot;. </P>
<P>Note that character ranges are highly locale dependent: they match any
character that collates between the endpoints of the range, ranges will only
behave according to ASCII rules when the default &quot;C&quot; locale is in
effect. For example if the library is compiled with the Win32 localization
model, then [a-z] will match the ASCII characters a-z, and also 'A', 'B' etc,
but not 'Z' which collates just after 'z'. This locale specific behaviour can
be disabled by specifying regbase::nocollate when compiling, this is the
default behaviour when using regbase::normal, and forces ranges to collate
according to ASCII character code. Likewise, if you use the POSIX C API
functions then setting REG_NOCOLLATE turns off locale dependent collation. </P>
<P>Character classes are denoted using the syntax &quot;[:classname:]&quot;
within a set declaration, for example &quot;[[:space:]]&quot; is the set of all
whitespace characters. Character classes are only available if the flag
regbase::char_classes is set. The available character classes are: <BR>

</TABLE>
<P>There are some shortcuts that can be used in place of the character classes,
provided the flag regbase::escape_in_lists is set then you can use: </P>
<P>\w in place of [:word:] </P>
<P>\s in place of [:space:] </P>
<P>\d in place of [:digit:] </P>
<P>\l in place of [:lower:] </P>
<P>\u in place of [:upper:] <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp; </P>
<P>Collating elements take the general form [.tagname.] inside a set
declaration, where <I>tagname</I> is either a single character, or a name of a
collating element, for example [[.a.]] is equivalent to [a], and [[.comma.]] is
equivalent to [,]. The library supports all the standard POSIX collating
element names, and in addition the following digraphs: &quot;ae&quot;,
&quot;ch&quot;, &quot;ll&quot;, &quot;ss&quot;, &quot;nj&quot;, &quot;dz&quot;,
&quot;lj&quot;, each in lower, upper and title case variations. Multi-character
collating elements can result in the set matching more than one character, for
example [[.ae.]] would match two characters, but note that [^[.ae.]] would only
match one character. <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp; </P>
<P>Equivalence classes take the general form [=tagname=] inside a set
declaration, where <I>tagname</I> is either a single character, or a name of a
collating element, and matches any character that is a member of the same
primary equivalence class as the collating element [.tagname.]. An equivalence
class is a set of characters that collate the same, a primary equivalence class
is a set of characters whose primary sort key are all the same (for example
strings are typically collated by character, then by accent, and then by case;
the primary sort key then relates to the character, the secondary to the
accentation, and the tertiary to the case). If there is no equivalence class
corresponding to <I>tagname</I>, then [=tagname=] is exactly the same as
[.tagname.]. Unfortunately there is no locale independent method of obtaining
the primary sort key for a character, except under Win32. For other operating
systems the library will &quot;guess&quot; the primary sort key from the full
sort key (obtained from <I>strxfrm</I>), so equivalence classes are probably
best considered broken under any operating system other than Win32. <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp; </P>
<P>To include a literal &quot;-&quot; in a set declaration then: make it the
first character after the opening &quot;[&quot; or &quot;[^&quot;, the endpoint
of a range, a collating element, or if the flag regbase::escape_in_lists is set
then precede with an escape character as in &quot;[\-]&quot;. To include a
literal &quot;[&quot; or &quot;]&quot; or &quot;^&quot; in a set then make them
the endpoint of a range, a collating element, or precede with an escape
character if the flag regbase::escape_in_lists is set. <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp; </P>
<P><I>Line anchors</I> </P>
<P>An anchor is something that matches the null string at the start or end of a
line: &quot;^&quot; matches the null string at the start of a line,
&quot;$&quot; matches the null string at the end of a line. <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp; </P>
<P><I>Back references</I> </P>
<P>A back reference is a reference to a previous sub-expression that has
already been matched, the reference is to what the sub-expression matched, not
to the expression itself. A back reference consists of the escape character
&quot;\&quot; followed by a digit &quot;1&quot; to &quot;9&quot;,
&quot;\1&quot; refers to the first sub-expression, &quot;\2&quot; to the second
etc. For example the expression &quot;(.*)\1&quot; matches any string that is
repeated about its mid-point for example &quot;abcabc&quot; or
&quot;xyzxyz&quot;. A back reference to a sub-expression that did not
participate in any match, matches the null string: NB this is different to some
other regular expression matchers. Back references are only available if the
expression is compiled with the flag regbase::bk_refs set. <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp; </P>
<P><I>Characters by code</I> </P>
<P>This is an extension to the algorithm that is not available in other
libraries, it consists of the escape character followed by the digit
&quot;0&quot; followed by the octal character code. For example
&quot;\023&quot; represents the character whose octal code is 23. Where
ambiguity could occur use parentheses to break the expression up:
&quot;\0103&quot; represents the character whose code is 103, &quot;(\010)3
represents the character 10 followed by &quot;3&quot;. To match characters by
their hexadecimal code, use \x followed by a string of hexadecimal digits,
optionally enclosed inside {}, for example \xf0 or \x{aff}, notice the latter
example is a Unicode character. <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp; </P>
<P><I>Word operators</I> </P>
<P>The following operators are provided for compatibility with the GNU regular
expression library. </P>
<P>&quot;\w&quot; matches any single character that is a member of the
&quot;word&quot; character class, this is identical to the expression
&quot;[[:word:]]&quot;. </P>
<P>&quot;\W&quot; matches any single character that is not a member of the
&quot;word&quot; character class, this is identical to the expression
&quot;[^[:word:]]&quot;. </P>
<P>&quot;\&lt;&quot; matches the null string at the start of a word. </P>
<P>&quot;\&gt;&quot; matches the null string at the end of the word. </P>
<P>&quot;\b&quot; matches the null string at either the start or the end of a
word. </P>
<P>&quot;\B&quot; matches a null string within a word. </P>
<P>The start of the sequence passed to the matching algorithms is considered to
be a potential start of a word unless the flag match_not_bow is set. The end of
the sequence passed to the matching algorithms is considered to be a potential
end of a word unless the flag match_not_eow is set. <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp; </P>
<P><I>Buffer operators</I> </P>
<P>The following operators are provide for compatibility with the GNU regular
expression library, and Perl regular expressions: </P>
<P>&quot;\`&quot; matches the start of a buffer. </P>
<P>&quot;\A&quot; matches the start of the buffer. </P>
<P>&quot;\'&quot; matches the end of a buffer. </P>
<P>&quot;\z&quot; matches the end of a buffer. </P>
<P>&quot;\Z&quot; matches the end of a buffer, or possibly one or more new line
characters followed by the end of the buffer. </P>
<P>A buffer is considered to consist of the whole sequence passed to the
matching algorithms, unless the flags match_not_bob or match_not_eob are set. 
<BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp; </P>
<P><I>Escape operator</I> </P>
<P>The escape character &quot;\&quot; has several meanings. </P>
<P>Inside a set declaration the escape character is a normal character unless
the flag regbase::escape_in_lists is set in which case whatever follows the
escape is a literal character regardless of its normal meaning. </P>
<P>The escape operator may introduce an operator for example: back references,
or a word operator. </P>
<P>The escape operator may make the following character normal, for example
&quot;\*&quot; represents a literal &quot;*&quot; rather than the repeat
operator. <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp; </P>
<P><I>Single character escape sequences</I> </P>
<P>The following escape sequences are aliases for single characters: <BR>

&nbsp; <P><I>What gets matched?</I> </P>
<P>The regular expression library will match the first possible matching
string, if more than one string starting at a given location can match then it
matches the longest possible string, unless the flag match_any is set, in which
case the first match encountered is returned. Use of the match_any option can
reduce the time taken to find the match - but is only useful if the user is
less concerned about what matched - for example it would not be suitable for
search and replace operations. In cases where their are multiple possible
matches all starting at the same location, and all of the same length, then the
match chosen is the one with the longest first sub-expression, if that is the
same for two or more matches, then the second sub-expression will be examined
and so on. <BR>
