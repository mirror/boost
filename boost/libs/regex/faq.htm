<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Q. Configure says that my compiler is unable to merge
template instances, what does this mean?</FONT> </P>
<P>A. When you compile template code, you can end up with the same template
instances in multiple translation units - this will lead to link time errors
unless your compiler/linker is smart enough to merge these template instances
into a single record in the executable file. If you see this warning after
running configure, then you can still link to libregex++.a if: </P>
<OL>
<LI> You use only the low-level template classes (reg_expression&lt;&gt;
match_results&lt;&gt; etc), from a single translation unit, and use no other part
of regex++.</LI>
<LI> You use only the POSIX API functions (regcomp regexec etc), and no other
part of regex++.</LI>
<LI> You use only the high level class RegEx, and no other part of regex++.
</LI>
</OL>
Another option is to create a master include file, which #include's all the
regex++ source files, and all the source files in which you use regex++. You
then compile and link this master file as a single translation unit. <P><FONT
COLOR="#FF0000">Q. Configure says that my compiler is unable to merge template
instances from archive files, what does this mean?</FONT> </P>
<P>A. When you compile template code, you can end up with the same template
instances in multiple translation units - this will lead to link time errors
unless your compiler/linker is smart enough to merge these template instances
into a single record in the executable file. Some compilers are able to do this
for normal .cpp or .o files, but fail if the object file has been placed in a
library archive. If you see this warning after running configure, then you can
still link to libregex++.a if: </P>
<OL>
<LI> You use only the low-level template classes (reg_expression&lt;&gt;
match_results&lt;&gt; etc), and use no other part of regex++.</LI>
<LI> You use only the POSIX API functions (regcomp regexec etc), and no other

<LI> You use only the high level class RegEx, and no other part of regex++.
</LI>
</OL>
Another option is to add the regex++ source files directly to your project
instead of linking to libregex++.a, generally you should do this only if you
are getting link time errors with libregex++.a. <P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Q.
Configure says that my compiler can't merge templates containing switch
statements, what does this mean?</FONT> </P>
<P>A. Some compilers can't merge templates that contain static data - this
includes switch statements which implicitly generate static data as well as
code. Principally this affects the egcs compiler - but note gcc 2.81 also
suffers from this problem - the compiler will compile and link the code - but
the code will not run because the code and the static data it uses have become
separated. The default behaviour of regex++ is to try and fix this problem by
declaring &quot;problem&quot; templates inside unnamed namespaces, so that the
templates have internal linkage. Note that this can result in a great deal of
code bloat. If the compiler doesn't support namespaces, or if code bloat
becomes a problem, then follow the guidelines above for placing all the
templates used in a single translation unit, and edit jm_opt.h so that
BOOST_RE_NO_TEMPLATE_SWITCH_MERGE is no longer defined. </P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Q. I can't get regex++ to work with escape characters,
what's going on?</FONT> </P>
<P>A. If you embed regular expressions in C++ code, then remember that escape
characters are processed twice: once by the C++ compiler, and once by the
regex++ expression compiler, so to pass the regular expression \d+ to regex++,
you need to embed &quot;\\d+&quot; in your code. Likewise to match a literal
backslash you will need to embed &quot;\\\\&quot; in your code. </P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Q. Why don't character ranges work properly?</FONT> 
<BR>
A. The POSIX standard specifies that character range expressions are locale
sensitive - so for example the expression [A-Z] will match any collating
element that collates between 'A' and 'Z'. That means that for most locales
other than &quot;C&quot; or &quot;POSIX&quot;, [A-Z] would match the single
character 't' for example, which is not what most people expect - or at least
not what most people have come to expect from regular expression engines. For
this reason, the default behaviour of regex++ is to turn locale sensitive
collation off by setting the regbase::nocollate compile time flag (this is set
by regbase::normal). However if you set a non-default compile time flag - for
example regbase::extended or regbase::basic, then locale dependent collation
will be enabled, this also applies to the POSIX API functions which use either
regbase::extended or regbase::basic internally, in the latter case use
REG_NOCOLLATE in combination with either REG_BASIC or REG_EXTENDED when
invoking regcomp if you don't want locale sensitive collation. <I>[Note - when
regbase::nocollate in effect, the library behaves &quot;as if&quot; the
LC_COLLATE locale category were always &quot;C&quot;, regardless of what its
actually set to - end note</I>]. </P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">&nbsp;Q. Why can't I use the &quot;convenience&quot;
versions of query_match/reg_search/reg_grep/reg_format/reg_merge?</FONT> </P>
<P>A. These versions may or may not be available depending upon the
capabilities of your compiler, the rules determining the format of these
functions are quite complex - and only the versions visible to a standard
compliant compiler are given in the help. To find out what your compiler
supports, run &lt;boost/regex.hpp&gt; through your C++ pre-processor, and
search the output file for the function that you are interested in. </P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Q. Why are there no throw specifications on any of the
functions? What exceptions can the library throw?</FONT> </P>
<P>A. Not all compilers support (or honor) throw specifications, others support
them but with reduced efficiency. Throw specifications may be added at a later
date as compilers begin to handle this better. The library should throw only
three types of exception: boost::bad_expression can be thrown by reg_expression
when compiling a regular expression; boost::bad_pattern can be thrown by the
class sub_match's conversion operators; finally std::bad_alloc can be thrown by
just about any of the functions in this library. <BR>
