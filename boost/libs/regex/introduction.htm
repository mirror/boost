<h3><a name="intro"><i></i></a><i>Introduction</i></h3>

<p>Regular expressions are a form of pattern-matching that are
often used in text processing; many users will be familiar with
the Unix utilities <i>grep</i>, <i>sed</i> and <i>awk</i>, and
the programming language <i>perl</i>, each of which make
extensive use of regular expressions. Traditionally C++ users
have been limited to the POSIX C API's for manipulating regular
expressions, and while regex++ does provide these API's, they do
not represent the best way to use the library. For example regex++
can cope with wide character strings, or search and replace
operations (in a manner analogous to either sed or perl),
something that traditional C libraries can not do.</p>

<p>The class <a href="template_class_ref.htm#reg_expression">boost::reg_expression</a>
is the key class in this library; it represents a &quot;machine
readable&quot; regular expression, and is very closely modelled
on std::basic_string, think of it as a string plus the actual
state-machine required by the regular expression algorithms. Like
std::basic_string there are two typedefs that are almost always
the means by which this class is referenced:</p>

<pre><b>namespace </b>boost{

<b>template</b> &lt;<b>class</b> charT, 
<b>          class</b> traits = regex_traits&lt;charT&gt;, 
          <b>class</b> Allocator = std::allocator&lt;charT&gt; &gt;
<b>class</b> reg_expression;

<b>typedef</b> reg_expression&lt;<b>char</b>&gt; regex;
<b>typedef</b> reg_expression&lt;<b>wchar_t&gt;</b> wregex;

}</pre>

<p>To see how this library can be used, imagine that we are
writing a credit card processing application. Credit card numbers
generally come as a string of 16-digits, separated into groups of
4-digits, and separated by either a space or a hyphen. Before
storing a credit card number in a database (not necessarily
something your customers will appreciate!), we may want to verify
that the number is in the correct format. To match any digit we
could use the regular expression [0-9], however ranges of
characters like this are actually locale dependent. Instead we
should use the POSIX standard form [[:digit:]], or the regex++
and perl shorthand for this \d (note that many older libraries
tended to be hard-coded to the C-locale, consequently this was
not an issue for them). That leaves us with the following regular
expression to validate credit card number formats:</p>

<p>(\d{4}[- ]){3}\d</p>

<p>Here the parenthesis act to group (and mark for future
reference) sub-expressions, and the {4} means &quot;repeat
exactly 4 times&quot;. This is an example of the extended regular
expression syntax used by perl, awk and egrep. Regex++ also
supports the older &quot;basic&quot; syntax used by sed and grep,
but this is generally less useful, unless you already have some
basic regular expressions that you need to reuse.</p>

<p>Now lets take that expression and place it in some C++ code to
validate the format of a credit card number:</p>

<pre><b>bool</b> validate_card_format(<b>const</b> std::string s)
{
   <b>static</b> <b>const</b> <a
href="template_class_ref.htm#reg_expression">boost::regex</a> e(&quot;(\\d{4}[- ]){3}\\d{4}&quot;);
   <b>return</b> <a href="template_class_ref.htm#query_match">regex_match</a>(s, e);
}</pre>

<p>Note how we had to add some extra escapes to the expression:
remember that the escape is seen once by the C++ compiler, before
it gets to be seen by the regular expression engine, consequently
escapes in regular expressions have to be doubled up when
embedding them in C/C++ code.</p>

<p>Those of you who are familiar with credit card processing,
will have realised that while the format used above is suitable
for human readable card numbers, it does not represent the format
required by online credit card systems; these require the number
as a string of 16 (or possibly 15) digits, without any
intervening spaces. What we need is a means to convert easily
between the two formats, and this is where search and replace
comes in. Those who are familiar with the utilities <i>sed</i>
and <i>perl</i> will already be ahead here; we need two strings -
one a regular expression - the other a &quot;<a
href="format_string.htm">format string</a>&quot; that provides a
description of the text to replace the match with. In regex++
this search and replace operation is performed with the algorithm
regex_merge, for our credit card example we can write two
algorithms like this to provide the format conversions:</p>

<pre>
<i>// match any format with the regular expression:
</i><b>const</b> boost::regex e(&quot;\\A(\\d{3,4})[- ]?(\\d{4})[- ]?(\\d{4})[- ]?(\\d{4})\\z&quot;);
<b>const</b> std::string machine_format(&quot;\\1\\2\\3\\4&quot;);
<b>const</b> std::string human_format(&quot;\\1-\\2-\\3-\\4&quot;);

std::string machine_readable_card_number(<b>const</b> std::string s)
{
   <b>return</b> <a href="template_class_ref.htm#reg_merge">regex_merge</a>(s, e, machine_format, boost::match_default | boost::format_sed);
}

std::string human_readable_card_number(<b>const</b> std::string s)
{
   <b>return</b> <a href="template_class_ref.htm#reg_merge">regex_merge</a>(s, e, human_format, boost::match_default | boost::format_sed);
}</pre>

<p>Here we've used marked sub-expressions in the regular
expression to split out the four parts of the card number as
separate fields, the format string then uses the sed-like syntax
to replace the matched text with the reformatted version.</p>

<p>In the examples above, we haven't directly manipulated the
results of a regular expression match, however in general the
result of a match contains a number of sub-expression matches in
addition to the overall match. When the library needs to report a
regular expression match it does so using an instance of the
class <a href="template_class_ref.htm#reg_match">match_results</a>,
as before there are typedefs of this class for the two most
common cases: </p>

<pre><b>namespace </b>boost{
<b>typedef</b> match_results&lt;<b>const</b> <b>char</b>*&gt; cmatch;
<b>typedef</b> match_results&lt;<b>const</b> <b>wchar_t</b>*&gt; wcmatch;
}</pre>

<p>The algorithms <a href="template_class_ref.htm#reg_search">regex_search</a>
and <a href="template_class_ref.htm#reg_grep">regex_grep</a> (i.e.
finding all matches in a string) make use of match_results to
report what matched.</p>

<p>Note that these algorithms are not restricted to searching
regular C-strings, any bidirectional iterator type can be
searched, allowing for the possibility of seamlessly searching
almost any kind of data. </p>

<p>For search and replace operations in addition to the algorithm
<a href="template_class_ref.htm#reg_merge">regex_merge</a> that
we have already seen, the algorithm <a
href="template_class_ref.htm#reg_format">regex_format</a> takes
the result of a match and a format string, and produces a new
string by merging the two.</p>

<p>For those that dislike templates, there is a high level
wrapper class RegEx that is an encapsulation of the lower level
template code - it provides a simplified interface for those that
don't need the full power of the library, and supports only
narrow characters, and the &quot;extended&quot; regular
expression syntax. </p>

<p>The <a href="posix_ref.htm#posix">POSIX API</a> functions:
regcomp, regexec, regfree and regerror, are available in both
narrow character and Unicode versions, and are provided for those
who need compatibility with these API's. </p>

<p>Finally, note that the library now has run-time <a
href="appendix.htm#localisation">localization</a> support, and
recognizes the full POSIX regular expression syntax - including
advanced features like multi-character collating elements and
equivalence classes - as well as providing compatibility with
other regular expression libraries including GNU and BSD4 regex
packages, and to a more limited extent perl 5. </p>

<h3><a name="Installation"><i></i></a><i>Installation and
Configuration Options</i> </h3>

<p><em>[ </em><strong><i>Important</i></strong><em>: If you are
upgrading from version 3.03x of this library then you will find a
number of changes to the documented header names and library
interfaces, existing code should still compile unchanged however
- see </em><a href="appendix.htm#upgrade"><font color="#0000FF"><em>Note
for Upgraders</em></font></a><em>. ]</em></p>

<p>When you extract the library from its zip file, you must
preserve its internal directory structure (for example by using
the -d option when extracting). If you didn't do that when
extracting, then you'd better stop reading this, delete the files
you just extracted, and try again! </p>

<p>Currently the library will automatically detect and configure
itself for Borland, Microsoft and gcc compilers only. The library
will also detect the HP, SGI, Rogue Wave, or Microsoft STL
implementations. If the STL type is detected, then the library
will attempt to extract suitable compiler configuration options
from the STL used. Otherwise the library will assume that the
compiler is fully compliant with the C++ standard: unless various
options are defined to depreciate features not implemented by
your compiler. These options are documented in &lt;boost/re_detail/regex_options.hpp&gt;,
if you want to add permanent configuration options add them to
&lt;boost/re_detail/regex_options.hpp&gt; which is provided for
this purpose - this will allow you to keep your configuration
options between library versions by retaining &lt;boost/re_detail/regex_options.hpp&gt;.
</p>

<p>The library will encase all code inside namespace boost. </p>

<p>Unlike some other template libraries, this library consists of
a mixture of template code (in the headers) and static code and
data (in cpp files). Consequently it is necessary to build the
library's support code into a library or archive file before you
can use it, instructions for specific platforms are as follows: </p>

<p><b>Borland C++ Builder:</b> </p>

<ul>
    <li>Open up a console window and change to the &lt;boost&gt;\libs\regex\lib
        directory. </li>
    <li>Select the appropriate makefile (bcb4.mak for C++ Builder
        4, bcb5.mak for C++ Builder 5, and bcc55.mak for the 5.5
        command line tools). </li>
    <li>Invoke the makefile (pass the full path to your version
        of make if you have more than one version installed, the
        makefile relies on the path to make to obtain your C++
        Builder installation directory and tools) for example: </li>
</ul>

<pre>make -fbcb5.mak</pre>

<p>The build process will build a variety of .lib and .dll files
(the exact number depends upon the version of Borland's tools you
are using) the .lib and dll files will be in a sub-directory
called bcb4 or bcb5 depending upon the makefile used. To install
the libraries into your development system use:</p>

<p>make -fbcb5.mak install</p>

<p>library files will be copied to &lt;BCROOT&gt;/lib and the dll's
to &lt;BCROOT&gt;/bin, where &lt;BCROOT&gt; corresponds to the
install path of your Borland C++ tools. </p>

<p>You may also remove temporary files created during the build
process (excluding lib and dll files) by using:</p>

<p>make -fbcb5.mak clean</p>

<p>Finally when you use regex++ it is only necessary for you to
add the &lt;boost&gt; root director to your list of include
directories for that project. It is not necessary for you to
manually add a .lib file to the project; the headers will
automatically select the correct .lib file for your build mode
and tell the linker to include it. There is one caveat however:
the library can not tell the difference between VCL and non-VCL
enabled builds when building a GUI application from the command
line, if you build from the command line with the 5.5 command
line tools then you must define the pre-processor symbol _NO_VCL
in order to ensure that the correct link libraries are selected:
the C++ Builder IDE normally sets this automatically. Hint, users
of the 5.5 command line tools may want to add a -D_NO_VCL to bcc32.cfg
in order to set this option permanently. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<p><b>Microsoft Visual C++ 6</b> </p>

<p>You need version 6 of MSVC to build this library. If you are
using VC5 then you may want to look at one of the previous
releases of this <a
href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/john_maddock/regexpp.htm">library</a>
</p>

<p>Open up a command prompt, which has the necessary MSVC
environment variables defined (for example by using the batch
file Vcvars32.bat installed by the Visual Studio installation),
and change to the &lt;boost&gt;\libs\regex\lib directory. </p>

<p>Select the correct makefile - vc6.mak for &quot;vanilla&quot;
Visual C++ 6 or vc6-stlport.mak if you are using STLPort.</p>

<p>Invoke the makefile like this:</p>

<p>nmake -fvc6.mak</p>

<p>You will now have a collection of lib and dll files in a
&quot;vc6&quot; subdirectory, to install these into your
development system use:</p>

<p>nmake -fvc6.mak install</p>

<p>The lib files will be copied to your &lt;VC6&gt;\lib directory
and the dll files to &lt;VC6&gt;\bin, where &lt;VC6&gt; is the
root of your Visual C++ 6 installation.</p>

<p>You can delete all the temporary files created during the
build (excluding lib and dll files) using:</p>

<p>nmake -fvc6.mak clean </p>

<p>Finally when you use regex++ it is only necessary for you to
add the &lt;boost&gt; root directory to your list of include
directories for that project. It is not necessary for you to
manually add a .lib file to the project; the headers will
automatically select the correct .lib file for your build mode
and tell the linker to include it. </p>

<p><em><strong>Important</strong></em><em>: there have been some
reports of compiler-optimisation bugs affecting this library, the
workaround is to build the library using /Oityb1 rather than /O2.
That is to use all optimisation settings except /Oa. This problem
is reported to affect some standard library code as well (in fact
I'm not sure if the problem is with the regex code or the
underlying standard library), so it's probably worthwhile
applying this workaround in normal practice in any case.</em></p>

<p>Note: if you have replaced the C++ standard library that comes
with VC6, then when you build the library you must ensure that
the environment variables &quot;INCLUDE&quot; and &quot;LIB&quot;
have been updated to reflect the include and library paths for
the new library - see vcvars32.bat (part of your Visual Studio
installation) for more details. </p>

<p>If you are building with the full STLPort v4, then use the vc6-stlport.mak
file provided (The full STLPort libraries appear not to support
single-thread static builds). <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<p><b>GCC(2.95)</b> </p>

<p>There is a conservative makefile for the g++ compiler. From
the command prompt change to the &lt;boost&gt;/libs/regex/lib
directory and type: </p>

<p>make -fgcc.mak </p>

<p>At the end of the build process you should have a gcc sub-directory
containing release and debug versions of the library (libregex++.a
and libregex++debug.a). When you build projects that use regex++,
you will need to add the boost install directory to your list of
include paths and add &lt;boost&gt;/libs/gcc/regex++ to your list
of library files. </p>

<p>Otherwise: run configure, this will set up the headers and
generate makefiles, from the command prompt change to the &lt;boost&gt;/libs/regex
directory and type: </p>

<pre><tt>configure
make</tt></pre>

<p>Other make options include: </p>

<p>make jgrep: builds the jgrep demo. </p>

<p>make test: builds and runs the regression tests. </p>

<p>make timer: builds the timer demo program. </p>

<p>Note: gcc2.95.x on Win32 is only supported as cygwin and <b><i>not</i></b>
mingw32 (sorry but compiler related bugs prevent this). </p>

<p><b>Other compilers:</b> </p>

<p>Run configure, this will set up the headers and generate
makefiles: from the command prompt change to the &lt;boost&gt;/libs/regex
directory and type: </p>

<pre><tt>configure
make</tt></pre>

<p>Other make options include: </p>

<p>make jgrep: builds the jgrep demo. </p>

<p>make test: builds and runs the regression tests. </p>

<p>make timer: builds the timer demo program. </p>

<p><b>Troubleshooting:</b> </p>

<p>If make fails after running configure, you may need to
manually disable some options: configure uses simple tests to
determine what features your compiler supports, it does not
stress the compiler's internals to any degree as the actual regex++
code can do. Other compiler features may be implemented (and
therefore detected by configure) but known to be buggy, again in
this case it may be necessary to disable the feature in order to
compile regex++ to stable code. The output file from configure is
&lt;boost&gt;/boost/re_detail/regex_options.hpp, this file lists
all the macros that can be defined to configure regex++ along
with a description to illustrate their usage, experiment changing
options in regex_options.hpp one at a time until you achieve the
effect you require. If you mail me questions about configure
output, be sure to include both regex_options.hpp and config.log
with your message. </p>
