<H3> <A NAME="implementation"></A>Appendix 1: Implementation notes</H3>
This is the first port of regex++ to the boost library, and is based on regex++
2.x, see changes.txt for a full list of changes from the previous version.
There are no known functionality bugs except that POSIX style equivalence
classes are only guaranteed correct if the Win32 localization model is used
(the default for Win32 builds of the library). <P>There are some aspects of the
code that C++ puritans will consider to be poor style, in particular the use of
goto in some of the algorithms. The code could be cleaned up, by changing to a
recursive implementation, although it is likely to be slower in that case. </P>
<P>The performance of the algorithms should be satisfactory in most cases. For
example the times taken to match the ftp response expression
&quot;^([0-9]+)(\-| |$)(.*)$&quot; against the string &quot;100- this is a line
of ftp response which contains a message string&quot; are: BSD implementation
450 micro seconds, GNU implementation 271 micro seconds, regex++ 127 micro
seconds (Pentium P90, Win32 console app under MS Windows 95). </P>
<P>However it should be noted that there are some &quot;pathological&quot;
expressions which may require exponential time for matching; these all involve
nested repetition operators, for example attempting to match the expression
&quot;(a*a)*b&quot; against <I>N</I> letter a's requires time proportional to
<I>2<SUP>N</SUP></I>. These expressions can (almost) always be rewritten in
such a way as to avoid the problem, for example &quot;(a*a)*b&quot; could be
rewritten as &quot;a*b&quot; which requires only time linearly proportional to
<I>N</I> to solve. In the general case, non-nested repeat expressions require
time proportional to <I>N<SUP>2</SUP></I>, however if the clauses are mutually
exclusive then they can be matched in linear time - this is the case with
&quot;a*b&quot;, for each character the matcher will either match an
&quot;a&quot; or a &quot;b&quot; or fail, where as with &quot;a*a&quot; the
matcher can't tell which branch to take (the first &quot;a&quot; or the second)
and so has to try both. <I>Be careful how you write your regular expressions
and avoid nested repeats if you can! New to this version, some previously
pathological cases have been fixed - in particular searching for expressions
which contain leading repeats and/or leading literal strings should be much
faster than before. Literal strings are now searched for using the
Knuth/Morris/Pratt algorithm (this is used in preference to the Boyer/More
algorithm because it allows the tracking of newline characters).</I> </P>
<P><I>Some aspects of the POSIX regular expression syntax are implementation
defined:</I> </P>
<UL>
<LI> The &quot;leftmost-longest&quot; rule for determining what matches is
ambiguous, this library takes the &quot;obvious&quot; interpretation: find the
leftmost match, then maximize the length of each sub-expression in turn with
lower indexed sub-expressions taking priority over higher indexed
sub-expression.</LI>
<LI> The behavior of multi-character collating elements is ambiguous in the
standard, in particular expressions such as [a[.ae.]] may have subtle
inconsistencies lurking in them. This implementation matches bracket
expressions as follows: all bracket expressions match a single character only,
unless the expression contains a multi-character collating element, either on
its own, or as the endpoint to a range, in which case the expression may match
more than one character.</LI>
<LI> Repeated null expressions are repeated only once, they are treated
&quot;as if&quot; they were matched the maximum number of times allowed by the
expression.</LI>
<LI> The behavior of back references is ambiguous in the standard, in
particular it is unclear whether expressions of the form &quot;((ab*)\2)+&quot;
should be allowed. This implementation allows such expressions and the back
reference matches whatever the last sub-expression match was. This means that
at the end of the match, the back references may have matched strings different
from the final value of the sub-expression to which they refer.</LI>
</UL>
<HR>
<H3> <A NAME="threads"></A>Appendix 2: Thread safety</H3>
Class reg_expression&lt;&gt; and its typedefs regex and wregex are thread safe,
in that compiled regular expressions can safely be shared between threads. The
matching algorithms regex_match, regex_search, regex_grep, regex_format and
regex_merge are all re-entrant and thread safe. Class match_results is now
thread safe, in that the results of a match can be safely copied from one
thread to another (for example one thread may find matches and push
match_results instances onto a queue, while another thread pops them off the
other end), otherwise use a separate instance of match_results per thread. 
<P>The POSIX API functions are all re-entrant and thread safe, regular
expressions compiled with <I>regcomp</I> can also be shared between threads. 
</P>
<P>The class RegEx is only thread safe if each thread gets its own RegEx
instance (apartment threading) - this is a consequence of RegEx handling both
compiling and matching regular expressions. </P>
<P>Finally note that changing the global locale invalidates all compiled
regular expressions, therefore calling <I>set_locale</I> from one thread while
another uses regular expressions <I>will</I> produce unpredictable results. 
</P>
<P>There is also a requirement that there is only one thread executing prior to
the start of main(). <BR>
</P>

<H3> <A NAME="localisation"></A>Appendix 3: Localization</H3>
&nbsp;Regex++ provides extensive support for run-time localization, the
localization model used can be split into two parts: front-end and back-end. 
<P>Front-end localization deals with everything which the user sees - error
messages, and the regular expression syntax itself. For example a French
application could change [[:word:]] to [[:mot:]] and \w to \m. Modifying the
front end locale requires active support from the developer, by providing the
library with a message catalogue to load, containing the localized strings.
Front-end locale is affected by the LC_MESSAGES category only. </P>
<P>Back-end localization deals with everything that occurs after the expression
has been parsed - in other words everything that the user does not see or
interact with directly. It deals with case conversion, collation, and character
class membership. The back-end locale does not require any intervention from
the developer - the library will acquire all the information it requires for
the current locale from the underlying operating system / run time library.
This means that if the program user does not interact with regular expressions
directly - for example if the expressions are embedded in your C++ code - then
no explicit localization is required, as the library will take care of
everything for you. For example embedding the expression [[:word:]]+ in your
code will always match a whole word, if the program is run on a machine with,
for example, a Greek locale, then it will still match a whole word, but in
Greek characters rather than Latin ones. The back-end locale is affected by the
LC_TYPE and LC_COLLATE categories. </P>
<P>There are three separate localization mechanisms supported by regex++: </P>
<P><I>Win32 localization model.</I> </P>
<P>This is the default model when the library is compiled under Win32, and is
encapsulated by the traits class
<A HREF="template_class_ref.htm#regex_char_traits">w32_regex_traits</A>. When
this model is in effect there is a single global locale as defined by the
user's control panel settings, and returned by GetUserDefaultLCID. All the
settings used by regex++ are acquired directly from the operating system
bypassing the C run time library. Front-end localization requires a resource
dll, containing a string table with the user-defined strings. The traits class
exports the function: </P>
<P>static std::string set_message_catalogue(const std::string&amp; s); </P>
<P>which needs to be called with a string identifying the name of the resource
dll, <I>before</I> your code compiles any regular expressions (but not
necessarily before you construct any <I>reg_expression</I> instances): </P>
<P>boost::w32_regex_traits&lt;char&gt;::set_message_calalogue(&quot;mydll.dll&quot;);
</P>
<P>Note that this API sets the dll name for <I>both</I> the narrow and wide
character specializations of w32_regex_traits. </P>
<P>This model does not currently support thread specific locales (via
SetThreadLocale under Windows NT), the library provides full Unicode support
under NT, under Windows 9x the library degrades gracefully - characters 0 to
255 are supported, the remainder are treated as &quot;unknown&quot; graphic
characters. </P>
<P><I>C localization model.</I> </P>
<P>This is the default model when the library is compiled under an operating
system other than Win32, and is encapsulated by the traits class <I><A
HREF="template_class_ref.htm#regex_char_traits">c_regex_traits</A></I>, Win32
users can force this model to take effect by defining the pre-processor symbol
BOOST_RE_LOCALE_C. When this model is in effect there is a single global
locale, as set by <I>setlocale</I>. All settings are acquired from your run
time library, consequently Unicode support is dependent upon your run time
library implementation. Front end localization requires a POSIX message
catalogue. The traits class exports the function: </P>
<P>static std::string set_message_catalogue(const std::string&amp; s); </P>
<P>which needs to be called with a string identifying the name of the message
catalogue, <I>before</I> your code compiles any regular expressions (but not
necessarily before you construct any <I>reg_expression</I> instances): </P>
<P>boost::c_regex_traits&lt;char&gt;::set_message_calalogue(&quot;mycatalogue&quot;);
</P>
<P>Note that this API sets the dll name for <I>both</I> the narrow and wide
character specializations of c_regex_traits. If your run time library does not
support POSIX message catalogues, then you can either provide your own
implementation of &lt;nl_types.h&gt; or define BOOST_RE_NO_CAT to disable
front-end localization via message catalogues. </P>
<P>Note that calling <I>setlocale</I> invalidates all compiled regular
expressions, calling <TT>setlocale(LC_ALL, &quot;C&quot;)</TT> will make this
library behave equivalent to most traditional regular expression libraries
including version 1 of this library. </P>
<P><I><TT>C++ </TT>localization<TT> </TT>model<TT>.</TT></I> </P>
<P>This model is only in effect if the library is built with the pre-processor
symbol BOOST_RE_LOCALE_CPP defined. When this model is in effect each instance
of reg_expression&lt;&gt; has its own instance of std::locale, class
reg_expression&lt;&gt; also has a member function <I>imbue</I> which allows the
locale for the expression to be set on a per-instance basis. Front end
localization requires a POSIX message catalogue, which will be loaded via the
std::messages facet of the expression's locale, the traits class exports the
symbol: </P>
<P>static std::string set_message_catalogue(const std::string&amp; s); </P>
<P>which needs to be called with a string identifying the name of the message
catalogue, <I>before</I> your code compiles any regular expressions (but not
necessarily before you construct any <I>reg_expression</I> instances): </P>
<P>boost::cpp_regex_traits&lt;char&gt;::set_message_calalogue(&quot;mycatalogue&quot;);
</P>
<P>Note that calling reg_expression&lt;&gt;::imbue will invalidate any
expression currently compiled in that instance of reg_expression&lt;&gt;. This
model is the one which closest fits the ethos of the C++ standard library,
however it is the model which will produce the slowest code, and which is the
least well supported by current standard library implementations, for example I
have yet to find an implementation of std::locale which supports either message
catalogues, or locales other than &quot;C&quot; or &quot;POSIX&quot;. </P>
<P>Finally note that if you build the library with a non-default localization
model, then the appropriate pre-processor symbol (BOOST_RE_LOCALE_C or
BOOST_RE_LOCALE_CPP) must be defined both when you build the support library,
and when you include &lt;boost/regex.hpp&gt; or &lt;boost/cregex.hpp&gt; in
your code. The best way to ensure this is to add the #define to
&lt;boost/re_detail/jm_opt.h&gt;. </P>
<P><I>Providing a message catalogue:</I> </P>
<P>In order to localize the front end of the library, you need to provide the
library with the appropriate message strings contained either in a resource
dll's string table (Win32 model), or a POSIX message catalogue (C or C++
models). In the latter case the messages must appear in message set zero of the
catalogue. The messages and their id's are as follows: <BR>

&nbsp; <P>Finally, custom collating element names are loaded starting from
message id 400, and terminating when the first load thereafter fails. Each
message looks something like: &quot;tagname string&quot; where <I>tagname</I>
is the name used inside [[.tagname.]] and <I>string</I> is the actual text of
the collating element. Note that the value of collating element [[.zero.]] is
used for the conversion of strings to numbers - if you replace this with
another value then that will be used for string parsing - for example use the
Unicode character 0x0660 for [[.zero.]] if you want to use Unicode Arabic-Indic
digits in your regular expressions in place of Latin digits. </P>
<P>Note that the POSIX defined names for character classes and collating
elements are always available - even if custom names are defined, in contrast,
custom error messages, and custom syntax messages replace the default ones.

<H3> <A NAME="demos"></A>Appendix 4: Demo Applications</H3>
There are three demo applications that ship with this library, they all come
with makefiles for Borland, Microsoft and gcc compilers, otherwise you will
have to create your own makefiles. <H5>regress.exe: </H5>
<P>A regression test application that gives the matching/searching algorithms a
full workout. The presence of this program is your guarantee that the library
will behave as claimed - at least as far as those items tested are concerned -
if anyone spots anything that isn't being tested I'd be glad to hear about it.

<H5> jgrep.exe </H5>
<P>A simple grep implementation, run with no command line options to find out
its usage. Look at <A HREF="src/fileiter.cpp">fileiter.cpp</A>/fileiter.hpp and
the mapfile class to see an example of a &quot;smart&quot; bidirectional
iterator that can be used with regex++ or any other STL algorithm. </P>

<H3> <A NAME="headers"></A>Appendix 5: Header Files</H3>
There are two main headers used by this library: &lt;boost/regex.hpp&gt;
provides full access to the entire library, while &lt;boost/cregex.hpp&gt;
provides access to just the high level class RegEx, and the POSIX API
functions. <BR>

<H3> <A NAME="redist"></A>Appendix 6: Redistributables</H3>
&nbsp;If you are using Microsoft or Borland C++ and link to a dll version of
the run time library, then you will also link to one of the dll versions of
regex++. While these dll's are redistributable, there are no
&quot;standard&quot; versions, so when installing on the users PC, you should
place these in a directory private to your application, and not in the PC's
directory path. Note that if you link to a static version of your run time
library, then you will also link to a static version of regex++ and no dll's
will need to be distributed. The possible regex++ dll's are as follows: <BR>

<H3> <A NAME="upgrade"></A>Notes for upgraders</H3>
This version of regex++ is the first to be ported to the
<A HREF="http://www.boost.org">boost</A> project, and as a result has a number
of changes to comply with the boost coding guidelines. <P>Headers have been
changed from &lt;header&gt; or &lt;header.h&gt; to &lt;boost/header.hpp&gt; 
</P>
<P>The library namespace has changed from &quot;jm&quot;, to &quot;boost&quot;.
</P>
<P>The reg_xxx algorithms have been renamed regex_xxx (to improve naming
consistency). </P>
<P>Algorithm query_match has been renamed regex_match, and only returns true if
the expression matches the whole of the input string (think input data
validation). </P>
<P><I>Compiling existing code:</I> </P>
<P>The directory, libs/regex/old_include contains a set of headers that make
this version of regex++ compatible with previous ones, either add this
directory to your include path, or copy these headers to the root directory of
your boost installation. The contents of these headers are deprecated and
undocumented - really these are just here for existing code - for new projects
use the new header forms. <BR>
