<h2>Template <a name="functions next">functions next</a>() and prior()</h2>

<p>Certain data types, such as the C++ Standard Library's forward and
bidirectional iterators, do not provide addition and subtraction via operator+()
or operator-().&nbsp; This means that non-modifying computation of the next or
prior value requires a temporary, even though operator++() or operator--() is
provided.&nbsp; It also means that writing code like <code>itr+1</code> inside a
template restricts the iterator category to random access iterators.</p>

<p>The next() and prior() functions provide a simple way around these problems:</p>

<blockquote>

<pre>template &lt;class T&gt;
T next(T x) { return ++x; }

template &lt;class X&gt;
T prior(T x) { return --x; }</pre>

</blockquote>

<p>Usage is simple:</p>

<blockquote>

<pre>const std::list&lt;T&gt;::iterator p = get_some_iterator();
const std::list&lt;T&gt;::iterator prev = boost::prior(p);</pre>

<h2><a name="Class noncopyable">Class noncopyable</a></h2>

<p>Class <strong>noncopyable</strong> is a base class.&nbsp; Derive your own class from <strong>noncopyable</strong>
when you want to prohibit copy construction and copy assignment.</p>

<p>Some objects, particularly those which hold complex resources like files or
network connections, have no sensible copy semantics.&nbsp; Sometimes there are
possible copy semantics, but these would be of very limited usefulness and be
very difficult to implement correctly.&nbsp; Sometimes you're implementing a class that doesn't need to be copied
just yet and you don't want to take the time to write the appropriate functions.&nbsp;
Deriving from <b> noncopyable</b> will prevent the otherwise implicitly-generated
functions (which don't have the proper semantics) from becoming a trap for other programmers.</p>

<p>The traditional way to deal with these is to declare a private copy constructor and copy assignment, and then
document why this is done.&nbsp; But deriving from <b>noncopyable</b> is simpler
and clearer, and doesn't require additional documentation.</p>

<p>The program <a href="noncopyable_test.cpp">noncopyable_test.cpp</a> can be
used to verify class <b>noncopyable</b> works as expected. It has have been run successfully under
GCC 2.95, Metrowerks
CodeWarrior 5.0, and Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 sp 3.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<blockquote>
  <pre>// inside one of your own headers ...
#include &lt;boost/utility.hpp&gt;

class ResourceLadenFileSystem : noncopyable {
...</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>Rationale</h3>
<p>Class noncopyable has protected constructor and destructor members to
emphasize that it is to be used only as a base class.&nbsp; Dave Abrahams notes
concern about the effect on compiler optimization of adding (even trivial inline)
destructor declarations. He says &quot;Probably this concern is misplaced, because
noncopyable will be used mostly for classes which own resources and thus have non-trivial destruction semantics.&quot;</p>
