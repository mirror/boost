      <P>The header &lt;boost/static_assert.hpp&gt; supplies a single macro 
         BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT(x), which generates a compile time error message if the <a href="../../more/int_const_guidelines.htm">
            integral-constant-expression</a> <i>x</i> is not true. In other words it is 
         the compile time equivalent of the assert macro; this is sometimes known as a 
         "compile-time-assertion", but will be called a "static assertion" throughout 
         these docs. Note that if the condition is true, then the macro will generate 
         neither code nor data - and the macro can also be used at either namespace, 
         class or function scope. When used in a template, the static assertion will be 
         evaluated at the time the template is instantiated; this is particularly useful 
         for validating template parameters.
      </P>
      <p>One of the aims of BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT is to generate readable error messages. 
         These immediately tell the user that a library is being used in a manner that 
         is not supported. While error messages obviously differ from compiler to 
         compiler, but you should see something like:
      </p>
      <pre>Illegal use of STATIC_ASSERTION_FAILURE&lt;false&gt;</pre>
      <p>Which is intended to at least catch the eye!</p>
      <p>You can use BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT at any place where you can place a declaration, 
         that is at <a href="#class">class</a>, <a href="#function">function</a> or <a href="#namespace">
            namespace</a> scope, this is illustrated by the following examples:</p>
      <h3><a name="namespace"></a><A name="namespace"></A>Use at namespace scope.</h3>
      <p>The macro can be used at namespace scope, if there is some requirement must 
         always be true; generally this means some platform specific requirement. 
         Suppose we require that <b>int</b> be at least a 32-bit integral type, and that <b>
            wchar_t</b> be an unsigned type. We can verify this at compile time as 
         follows:</p>
      <pre>#include &lt;climits&gt;
#include &lt;cwchar&gt;
#include &lt;boost/static_assert.hpp&gt;

namespace my_conditions {

BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT(sizeof(int) * CHAR_BIT &gt;= 32);
BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT(WCHAR_MIN &gt;= 0);

} // namespace my_conditions
</pre>
      <p>The use of the namespace <i>my_conditions</i> here requires some comment. The 
         macro BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT works by generating an <strong>typedef</strong> declaration, 
         and since the typedef must have a name, the macro generates one automatically 
         by mangling a stub name with the value of __LINE__. When BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT is 
         used at either class or function scope then each use of BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT is 
         guaranteed to produce a name unique to that scope (provided you only use the 
         macro once on each line). However when used in a header at namespace scope, 
         that namespace can be continued over multiple headers, each of which may have 
         their own static assertions, and on the "same" lines, thereby generating 
         duplicate declarations. In theory the compiler should silently ignore duplicate 
         typedef declarations, however many do not do so (and even if they do they are 
         entitled to emit warnings in such cases). To avoid potential problems, if you 
         use BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT in a header and at namespace scope, then enclose them 
         in a namespace unique to that header.</p>
      <h3><a name="function"></a><A name="function"></A>Use at function scope</h3>
      <p>The macro is typically used at function scope inside template functions, when 
         the template arguments need checking. Imagine that we have an iterator-based 
         algorithm that requires random access iterators. If the algorithm is 
         instantiated with iterators that do not meet our requirements then an error 
         will be generated eventually, but this may be nested deep inside several 
         templates, making it hard for the user to determine what went wrong. One option 
         is to add a static assertion at the top level of the template, in that case if 
         the condition is not met, then an error will be generated in a way that makes 
         it reasonably obvious to the user that the template is being misused.</p>
      <pre>#include &lt;iterator&gt;
#include &lt;boost/static_assert.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;boost/type_traits.hpp&gt;

template &lt;class RandomAccessIterator &gt;
RandomAccessIterator foo(RandomAccessIterator from, RandomAccessIterator to)
{
   // this template can only be used with
   // random access iterators...
   typedef typename std::iterator_traits&lt; RandomAccessIterator &gt;::iterator_category cat;
   BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT((boost::is_convertible&lt;cat, const std::random_access_iterator_tag&amp;&gt;::value));
   //
   // detail goes here...
   return from;
}</pre>
      <p>A couple of footnotes are in order here: the extra set of parenthesis around 
         the assert, is to prevent the comma inside the is_convertible template being 
         interpreted by the preprocessor as a macro argument separator; the target type 
         for is_convertible is a reference type, as some compilers have problems using 
         is_convertible when the conversion is via a user defined constructor (in any 
         case there is no guarantee that the iterator tag classes are 
         copy-constructible).</p>
      <h3><a name="class"></a><A name="class"></A>Use at class scope</h3>
      <p>The macro is typically used inside classes that are templates. Suppose we have 
         a template-class that requires an unsigned integral type with at least 16-bits 
         of precision as a template argument, we can achieve this using something like 
         this:</p>
      <pre>#include &lt;climits&gt;
#include &lt;boost/static_assert.hpp&gt;

template &lt;class UnsignedInt&gt;
class myclass
{
private:
   BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT(sizeof(UnsignedInt) * CHAR_BIT &gt;= 16);
   BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT(std::numeric_limits&lt;UnsignedInt&gt;::is_specialized
                        &amp;&amp; std::numeric_limits&lt;UnsignedInt&gt;::is_integer
                        &amp;&amp; !std::numeric_limits&lt;UnsignedInt&gt;::is_signed);
public:
   /* details here */
};
</pre>
      <h3><A name="templates"></A>Use in templates</h3>
      <P>Normally static assertions when used inside a class or function template, will 
         not be instantiated until the template in which it is used is 
         instantiated.&nbsp; However, there is one potential problem to watch out for: 
         if the static assertion is <EM>not</EM> dependent upon&nbsp;one or 
         more&nbsp;template parameters, then the compiler is permitted to evaluate the 
         static assertion at the point it is first seen, irrespective of whether the 
         template is ever instantiated, for example:</P>
      <PRE>template &lt;class T&gt;<BR>struct must_not_be_instantiated<BR>{<BR>   BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT(false);<BR><BR><BR><BR>};</PRE>
      <P>Will produce a compiler error with some compilers (for example Intel 8.1 or gcc 
         3.4), regardless of whether the template is ever instantiated.&nbsp; A 
         workaround in cases like this is to force the assertion to be dependent upon a 
         template parameter:</P>
      <PRE>template &lt;class T&gt;<BR>struct must_not_be_instantiated<BR>{<BR>   BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT(sizeof(T) == 0); // will be triggered if this type is instantiated<BR><BR><BR><BR>};</PRE>
      <H3><A name="how"></A>How it works</H3>
      <p>BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT works as follows. There is class STATIC_ASSERTION_FAILURE 
         which is defined as:</p>
      <pre>namespace boost{

template &lt;bool&gt; struct STATIC_ASSERTION_FAILURE;

template &lt;&gt; struct STATIC_ASSERTION_FAILURE&lt;true&gt;{};

}</pre>
      <p>The key feature is that the error message triggered by the undefined expression 
         sizeof(STATIC_ASSERTION_FAILURE&lt;0&gt;), tends to be consistent across a wide 
         variety of compilers. The rest of the machinery of BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT is just 
         a way to feed the sizeof expression into a typedef. The use of a macro here is 
         somewhat ugly; however boost members have spent considerable effort trying to 
         invent a static assert that avoided macros, all to no avail. The general 
         conclusion was that the good of a static assert working at namespace, function, 
         and class scope outweighed the ugliness of a macro.</p>
