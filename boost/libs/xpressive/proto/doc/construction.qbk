[section:expression_construction Expression Construction: Building Proto Expression Trees]

We've seen some simple examples of how to use Proto, but we haven't really said
much about what is going on under the hood. How exactly does Proto build and
process expression trees? Now is the time to find out.

In the calculator example, we defined a placeholder terminal like this:

    // Define a placeholder type
    struct placeholder1 {};

    // Define the Proto-ified placeholder terminal
    terminal< placeholder1 >::type const _1 = {{}};

The actual type of `_1` looks like this:

    expr< tag::terminal, args0< placeholder1 >, 0 >

The _expr_ template is the most important type in Proto. Although you will
rarely need to deal with it directly, it's always there behind the scenes
holding your expression trees together. In fact, _expr_ /is/ the expression
tree -- braches, leaves and all. 

The _expr_ template makes up the nodes in expression trees. The first template
parameter is the node type; in this case, `proto::tag::terminal`. That means
that `_1` is a leaf-node in the expression tree. The second template parameter
is a list of children types. Terminals will always have only one type in the
type list. The last parameter is the arity of the expression. Terminals have
arity 0, unary expressions have arity 1, etc.

The _expr_ struct is defined as follows:

    template< typename Tag, typename Args, long Arity = Args::size >
    struct expr;

    template< typename Tag, typename Args >
    struct expr< Tag, Args, 1 >
    {
        typename Args::arg0 arg0;
        // ...
    };

The _expr_ struct does not define a constructor, or anything else that would
prevent static initialization. All _expr_ objects are initialized using
['aggregate initialization], with curly braces. In our example, `_1` is
initialized with the initializer `{{}}`. The outer braces is the initializer
for the _expr_ struct, and the inner braces are for the member `_1.arg0` which
is of type `placeholder1`. Note that we use braces to initialize `_1.arg0`
because `placeholder1` is also an aggregate.

[section:operator_overloads Proto's Operator Overloads]

Once we have some Proto terminals, expressions involving those terminals build
expression trees for us, as if by magic. It's not magic; Proto defines
overloads for each of C++'s overloadable operators to make it happen. As long
as one operand is a Proto expression, the result of the operation is a tree
node representing that operation.[footnote There are a couple of exceptions to
this. In ["`int x; x = _1`], the assignment isn't a Proto expression, even
though the right hand operand /is/ a Proto expression. That's just how C++ works.
The same is also true for the subscript operator and the function call
operator, as in ["`int *x; x[_1];`] and ["`std::sin(_1);`]. Them's the breaks,
as they say.]

[note The _expr_ struct lives in the `boost::proto` namespace, as do all of
Proto's operator overloads. The overloads are found via ADL (Argument-Dependent
Lookup). That is why expressions must be "tainted" with Proto-ness for Proto to
be able to build trees out of expressions.]

As a result of Proto's operator overloads, we can say:

    -_1;        // OK, build a unary-negate tree node
    _1 + 42;    // OK, build a binary-plus tree node

[endsect]

[section:expression_trees Building Expression Trees]

The `_1` node is an _expr_ type, and new nodes created with this type are
also _expr_ types. They look like this:

    // typeof( -_1 )
    expr<
        tag::negate
      , args1<
            ref_< expr< tag::terminal, args0< placeholder1 >, 0 > >
        >
      , 1
    >

    // typeof( _1 + 42 )
    expr<
        tag::plus
      , args2<
            ref_< expr< tag::terminal, args0< placeholder1 >, 0 > >
          , expr< tag::terminal, args0< int const & >, 0 >
        >
      , 2
    >

There are a few things to note about these types:

# Terminals have arity 0, unary expressions have arity 1 and binary expressions
  have arity 2.
# When one Proto expression is made a child node of another Proto expression,
  it is wrapped in _ref_, which is a simple reference wrapper. That is, Proto
  expressions hold their children by reference ['even if they are temporary
  objects]. This last point becomes important later.
# Non-Proto expressions, such as the integer literal, are turned into Proto
  expressions by making them Proto terminals. These terminal expressions
  are /not/ wrapped in _ref_, but the object itself /is/ held by reference.
  Notice that the type of the Proto-ified `42` literal is `int const &` -- held
  by reference.

The types make it clear: everything in a Proto expression tree is held by
reference. That means that building an expression tree is exceptionally cheap.
It involves no copying at all.

[note To use Proto effectively, you won't have to bother yourself with the
actual types that Proto generates. These are details, but you're likely to
encounter these types in compiler error messages, so it's helpful to be familiar
with them.]

[section:tags_and_meta_functions Operator Tags and Meta-Functions]

The following table lists the overloadable C++ operators, the Proto tag types
for each, and the name of the Proto meta-function for generating the 
corresponding Proto expression nodes. The meta-functions are also usable as
grammars for matching such nodes, as well as pass-through transforms, as
explained in later sections.
