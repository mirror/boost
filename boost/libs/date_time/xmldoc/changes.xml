          <entry>Bug Fix</entry>
          <entry>Snap to end of month behavior corrected for year_functor. Previously, starting from 2000-Feb-28 (leap year and not end of month) and iterating through the next leap year would result in 2004-Feb-29 instead of 2004-Feb-28. This behavior has been corrected to produce the correct result of 2004-Feb-28. Thanks to Bart Garst for this change.

          <entry>Feature</entry>
          <entry>Free function for creating a ptime object from a FILETIME struct. This function is only available on platforms that define BOOST_HAS_FTIME.

          <entry>Feature</entry>
          <entry>Use of the boost::serialization library is now available with many of the date_time classes. Classes capable of serialization are: date_generator classes, date, days, date_period, greg_month, greg_weekday, greg_day, ptime, time_duration, and time_period. Thanks to Bart Garst for this change.

          <entry>Free functions for date generators added. Functions are: days_until_weekday, days_before_weekday, next_weekday, and previous_weekday.
            <programlisting>
              days days_until_weekday(date, greg_weekday);
              days days_before_weekday(date, greg_weekday);

        <row>
          <entry>Feature</entry>
          <entry>New duration types added for months, years, and weeks. These classes also provide mathematical operators for use with date and time classes. Input streaming is not yet implemented for these types.
            <programlisting>
              months m(12);
              years y(1);
              m == y; // true
              days d(7);
              weeks w(1);
              d == w; // true</programlisting>
	    Thanks to Bart Garst for this change.
          </entry>
        </row>
        <row>
          <entry>Feature</entry>
          <entry>Unifying base class for date_generators brought in to gregorian namespace. See <link linkend="date_time.examples.print_holidays">Print Holidays Example</link>.
          </entry>
        </row>
        <row>
          <entry>Feature</entry>
          <entry>Added constructors for date and ptime that allow for default construction (both) and special values construction (ptime, both now support this). Default constructors initialize the objects to not_a_date_time (NADT).
            <programlisting>
              ptime p_nadt(not_a_date_time), p_posinf(pos_infin);
              ptime p; // p == NADT
              date d;  // d == NADT</programlisting>
	    Thanks to Bart Garst for this change.
          </entry>
        </row>
	<row>
	  <entry>Feature</entry>
	  <entry>Output streaming now supports wide stream output on compiler / standard library combinations that support wide streams. This allows code like:
	    <programlisting>
	      std::wstringstream wss;
	      date d(2003,Aug,21);
	      wss &lt;&lt; d;</programlisting>
	    Thanks to Bart Garst for this change.
	  </entry>
	</row>
	<row>
	  <entry>Feature</entry>
          <entry>Input streaming for date and time types is now supported on both wide and narrow streams:
	    <programlisting>
	      date d(not_a_date_time);
	      std::stringstream ss("2000-FEB-29");
	      ss &gt;&gt; d; //Feb 29th, 2000
              std::wstringstream ws("2000-FEB-29");
              ws &gt;&gt; d; //Feb 29th, 2000</programlisting>
	    Thanks to Bart Garst for this change.
	  </entry>
	</row>

	  <entry>Bug Fix</entry>
	  <entry>Fixed the special value constructor for date when constructing date(min_date_time) or date(max_date_time) the wrong value was constructed for these.</entry>

	</row>
	<row>
	  <entry>Bug Fix</entry>
	  <entry>Provided additional operators for duration types (eg: date_duration, time_duration). This includes dividable by integer and fixes to allow +=, -= operators. Thanks to Bart Garst for writing this code. Also, the documentation of <link linkend="date_time.calculations">Calculations</link> has been improved.</entry>

	<row>
	  <entry>Feature</entry>
	  <entry>Added a function to time_duration to get the total number of seconds in a duration truncating any fractional seconds. In addition, other resolutions were added to allow for easy conversions. For example
seconds(1).total_milliseconds() == 1000
seconds(1).total_microseconds() == 1000000
hours(1).total_milliseconds() == 3600*1000 //3600 sec/hour
seconds(1).total_nanoseconds() == 1000000000</entry>

	  <entry>Feature</entry>
	  <entry>Added output streaming operators for the <link linkend="date_time.gregorian.date_algorithms">date generator</link> classes - partial_date, first_kday_after, first_kday_before, etc. Thanks to Bart Garst for this work.</entry>
	</row>
	<row>
	  <entry>Feature</entry>
	  <entry>Added unary- operators for durations for reversing the sign of a time duration. For example:
	    <programlisting>
	      time_duration td(5,0,0); //5 hours
	      td = -td; //-5 hours</programlisting>
	  Thanks to Bart Garst for this work.</entry>
	</row>
	<row>
	  <entry>Feature</entry>
	  <entry>Added support for parsing strings with 'month names'. Thus creating a date object from string now accepts multiple formats ("2003-10-31","2003-Oct-31", and "2003-October-31"). Thus, date d = from_simple_string("2003-Feb-27") is now allowed. A bad month name string ( from_simple_string("2003-SomeBogusMonthName-27")) will cause a bad_month exception. On most compilers the string compare is case insensitive. Thanks to Bart Garst for this work.</entry>
	</row>
	<row>
	  <entry>Feature</entry>
	  <entry>In addition to support for month names or numbers, functions have been added to create date objects from multi-ordered date strings. Ex: "January-21-2002", "2002-Jan-21", and "21-Jan-2003". See <link linkend="date_time.gregorian.date">Date Class</link> for more details.</entry>

  <bridgehead renderas="sect3">Changes from Boost 1.29 to 1.30 (date_time 1.00 to 1.01)</bridgehead>
  <para>
    Notice: The interface to the partial_date class (see <link linkend="date_time.gregorian.algorithms">date_algorithms</link>) was changed. The order of construction parameters was changed which will cause some code to fail execution. This change was made to facilitate more generic local time adjustment code. Thus instead of specifying partial_date pd(Dec,25) the code needs to be changed to partial_date pd(25, Dec);
