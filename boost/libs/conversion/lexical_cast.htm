		<h2><a name="motivation">Motivation</a></h2>
		Sometimes a value must be converted to a literal text form, such as an <code>int</code>
		represented as a <code>string</code>, or vice-versa, when a <code>string</code> 
		is interpreted as an <code>int</code>. Such examples are common when converting 
		between data types internal to a program and representation external to a 
		program, such as windows and configuration files.
		<p>
		The standard C and C++ libraries offer a number of facilities for performing 
		such conversions. However, they vary with their ease of use, extensibility, and 
		safety.
		<p>
			For instance, there are a number of limitations with the family of standard C 
			functions typified by <code>atoi</code>:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Conversion is supported in one direction only: from text to internal data type. 
					Converting the other way using the C library requires either the inconvenience 
					and compromised safety of the <code>sprintf</code> function, or the loss of 
					portability associated with non-standard functions such as <code>itoa</code>.
				</li>
				<li>
					The range of types supported is only a subset of the built-in numeric types, 
					namely <code>int</code>, <code>long</code>, and <code>double</code>.
				</li>
				<li>
					The range of types cannot be extended in a uniform manner. For instance, 
					conversion from string representation to <code>complex</code> or <code>rational</code>.
				</li>
			</ul>
			The standard C functions typified by <code>strtol</code> have the same basic 
			limitations, but offer finer control over the conversion process. However, for 
			the common case such control is often either not required or not used. The <code>scanf</code>
		family of functions offer even greater control, but also lack safety and ease 
		of use.
		<p>
			The standard C++ library offers <code>stringstream</code> for the kind of 
			in-core formatting being discussed. It offers a great deal of control over the 
			formatting and conversion of I/O to and from arbitrary types through text. 
			However, for simple conversions direct use of <code>stringstream</code> can be 
			either clumsy (with the introduction of extra local variables and the loss of 
			infix-expression convenience) or obscure (where <code>stringstream</code>
		objects are created as temporary objects in an expression). Facets provide a 
		comprehensive concept and facility for controlling textual representation, but 
		their perceived complexity and high entry level requires an extreme degree of 
		involvement for simple conversions, and excludes all but a few programmers.
		<p>
			The <code>lexical_cast</code> function template offers a convenient and 
			consistent form for supporting common conversions to and from arbitrary types 
			when they are represented as text. The simplification it offers is in 
			expression-level convenience for such conversions. For more involved 
			conversions, such as where precision or formatting need tighter control than is 
			offered by the default behavior of <code>lexical_cast</code>, the conventional <code>
				stringstream</code> approach is recommended. Where the conversions are 
			numeric to numeric, <code><a href="cast.htm#numeric_cast">numeric_cast</a></code>
			may offer more reasonable behavior than <code>lexical_cast</code>
		.
		<p>
			For a good discussion of the options and issues involved in string-based 
			formatting, including comparison of <code>stringstream</code>, <code>lexical_cast</code>, 
			and others, see Herb Sutter's article, <a href="http://www.gotw.ca/publications/mill19.htm">
				<i>The String Formatters of Manor Farm</i></a>

			The following example treats command line arguments as a sequence of numeric 
			data: <blockquote>
				<pre>
int main(int argc, char * argv[])
{
    using boost::lexical_cast;
    using boost::bad_lexical_cast;

    std::vector&lt;short&gt; args;

    while(*++argv)
    {
        try
        {
            args.push_back(lexical_cast&lt;short&gt;(*argv));
        }
        catch(bad_lexical_cast &amp;)
        {
            args.push_back(0);
        }
    }
    ...
}
</pre>
			</blockquote>The following example uses numeric data in a string expression: <blockquote>
				<pre>
void log_message(const std::string &amp;);

void log_errno(int yoko)
{
    log_message(&quot;Error &quot; + boost::lexical_cast&lt;std::string&gt;(yoko) + &quot;: &quot; + strerror(yoko));
}
</pre>
			</blockquote>

			<blockquote>
				<pre>
template&lt;typename Target, typename Source&gt;
  Target lexical_cast(Source arg);
</pre>
			</blockquote>Returns the result of streaming <code>arg</code> into a <code>std::stringstream</code>
			and then out as a <code>Target</code> object. Note that spaces are significant 
			in any conversion and are not skipped. If the conversion is unsuccessful, a <a href="#bad_lexical_cast">
				<code>bad_lexical_cast</code></a>
		exception is thrown.
		<p>
			The requirements on the argument and result types are:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<code>Source</code> is <i>OutputStreamable</i>, meaning that an <code>operator&lt;&lt;</code>
					is defined that takes a <code>std::ostream</code> or <code>std::wostream</code> object on the
					left hand side and an instance of the argument type on the right.
				</li>
				<li>
					Both <code>Source</code> and <code>Target</code> are <i>CopyConstructible</i> [20.1.3].
				</li>
				<li>
					<code>Target</code> is <i>InputStreamable</i>, meaning that an <code>operator&gt;&gt;</code>
					is defined that takes a <code>std::istream</code> or <code>std::wistream</code> object on the left hand side 
					and an instance of the result type on the right.
				</li>
				<li>
					<code>Target</code> is <i>DefaultConstructible</i>, meaning that it is possible 
					to <i>default-initialize</i> an object of that type [8.5, 20.1.4].
				</li>
			</ul>
			The character type of the underlying stream is assumed to be <code>char</code> unless
			the either the <code>Source</code> or the <code>Target</code> type is <code>wchar_t</code>
			or a wide-character string type &#151; either <code>wchar_t *</code> or <code>std::wstring</code> &#151;
			in which case <code>wchar_t</code> is used.
			<p>
			Where a higher degree of control is required over conversions, <code>std::stringstream</code>
			and <code>std::wstringstream</code> offer a more appropriate path. Where non-stream-based conversions are 
			required, <code>lexical_cast</code>
		is the wrong tool for the job, and is not special-cased for such scenarios.
